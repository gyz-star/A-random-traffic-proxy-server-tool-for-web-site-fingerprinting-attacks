# 🔍A-random-traffic-proxy-server-tool-for-web-site-fingerprinting-attacks

## 🖊Introduction

This tool provides randomized traffic defense against **website fingerprinting attacks😈**. It creates a proxy server that modifies user access requests to thwart such threats. 

## ❓How to use

You can run it directly with commands to test its effectiveness, but be sure to prepare a dataset of web page access patterns beforehand.

Here's a piece of advice: You can launch the web page with some scripts and use **tshark🦈** to capture packets to get the traffic of the user accessing the web page for testing.
